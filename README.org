** Design

   The Emacs configuration focuses on minimum and maintenance:
   - I prefer to use pre-installed packages from Emacs.
   - The extra third-party plugins will be as minimum as possible so I could fix up myself.
   - Otherwise, I would prefer extensions maintained by a stable community.

** Customization

   You can customize the config through =custom.el=, which will be generated
   after first initialization.
